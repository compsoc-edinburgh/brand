        Student Tech MeetUp and Extraordinary General Meeting
      </i>

      <br />
      <br />

      At the <b>STMU</b> we will be hearing talks from industry speakers (with üçï and ü•§):
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Matt Henderson</b> - <i>Animating Mathematically</i> <br />
          <a href="https://www.matthen.com/">Matt Henderson</a>, has worked as a researcher in conversational language understanding at Google, Apple, PolyAI, and Reka. But in his spare time, he creates mathematical animations, explaining concepts like chaos theory with bouncing balls, breadth first search with lightning strike simulations, and cellular automata with Pok√©mon battles. In this talk, Matt will dive into a few of his animations, and the code used to generate them.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>Liam O'Connor</b> - <i>Why Domain Theory Matters</i> <br />
          Dive into the world of theoretical computer science with Dr. O'Connor's intriguing talk on 
          denotational semantics. This essential, yet often overlooked, branch connects computer 
          programs directly to mathematical concepts. It's a unique opportunity to explore a 
          fundamental aspect of computer science theory.
        </li>
      </ul>

      For the <b>EGM</b>, we're looking for enthusiastic individuals to take on the roles of Tech Secretary and Treasurer.
